## Introduction

Logto is an open-source identity solution that provides authentication and authorization services. The provider is configured with secure defaults and supports all major OIDC security features including PKCE, state, and nonce validation.
Due to the usage of encrypted access tokens, we are not able to validate access tokens.

## Example Configuration

::callout{icon="i-carbon-warning-alt" color="amber"}
Never store sensitive values like your client secret in your Nuxt config. Our recommendation is to inject at least client id and client secret via. environment variables.
::

### Minimal

```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
logto: {
  baseUrl: '',
  clientId: '',
  clientSecret: '',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/logto/callback',
  logoutRedirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000',
}
```

### Environment variables

Dotenv files are only for (local) development. Use a proper configuration management or injection system in production.

```ini [.env]
NUXT_OIDC_PROVIDERS_LOGTO_CLIENT_SECRET=CLIENT_SECRET
NUXT_OIDC_PROVIDERS_LOGTO_CLIENT_ID=CLIENT_ID
NUXT_OIDC_PROVIDERS_LOGTO_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_LOGTO_DOMAIN
```

## Provider specific parameters

The Logto provider supports several specific parameters to customize the authentication experience:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| firstScreen | `string` | - | Specifies the initial screen shown to users during authentication. This can be used to direct users to specific authentication flows. |
| identifier | `string`| - | Defines which identifier types are accepted in the sign-in or sign-up form. This allows you to restrict authentication methods. |
| loginHint | `string` | - | Pre-populates the identifier field with a user's email or username. Useful for improving user experience when the identity is known. |
| prompt | `'login' \| 'none' \| 'consent' \| 'select_account'` | `consent` | Controls the authentication behavior: 'login' forces authentication, 'none' prevents interaction, 'consent' requires explicit consent, and 'select_account' allows account selection. |

For Logto you have to provide at least the `baseUrl`, `clientId` and `clientSecret` properties. The `baseUrl` is used to dynamically create the `authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl`, `logoutUrl` and `userInfoUrl`.
